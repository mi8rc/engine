## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
- **GTK+ 3.0**: Chosen for cross-platform GUI with native look and feel
- **OpenGL**: Direct OpenGL for maximum performance and control
- **NURBS Implementation**: Custom implementation for precise mathematical control
- **IGES Parser**: From-scratch implementation for full format compliance
- **Memory Management**: Manual memory management for performance and control
- **Modular Design**: Separated concerns for maintainability and testing

### Performance Considerations
- **Tessellation**: Adaptive based on view distance and surface curvature
- **Rendering**: Frustum culling and level-of-detail optimization
- **Memory**: Pool allocation for frequently created/destroyed objects
- **Threading**: Prepared for multi-threaded operations in future versions

### Quality Assurance
- **Static Analysis**: Integrated cppcheck for code quality
- **Memory Safety**: AddressSanitizer and Valgrind integration
- **Code Style**: Consistent formatting with clang-format
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline and external documentation
- **Testing**: Framework prepared for unit and integration tests
